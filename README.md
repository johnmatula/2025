## What is this?
This is the repo for my portfolio website. Its pages are generated with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and supported with [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), making for a simple-to-develop site that loads quickly.


## Project structure

I take a cascading approach to this site, like CSS and Eleventy. The project structure reflects this:

* **assets** — images, media, downloadable files
* **content** — documents of text that include references to assets
* **blocks** — reusable components that define how content looks and behaves
* **layouts** — templates that define how those blocks come together on a page



## Miscellany

The site is typeset in two variable fonts originally made for the [Taiwan Space Agency](https://www.tasa.org.tw/en-US). They were designed by [Local Remote](https://www.localremote.co/) and have a [specimen site](https://www.localremote.co/tasa-typeface-collection) that shows them off super nicely.

Most of this site was designed in Sketch, which is my favorite and fast choice for  my 2014 MacBook Pro. (Figma’s Chromium-based app is less so, unsurprising for a decade-old computer.)
